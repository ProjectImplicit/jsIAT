## JS IAT

This is an IAT player that is based on the [project implicit](implicit.harvard.edu) flash IAT player.

It supports touch devices.

There are two base files you can use:

* `iattask.jsp` is built for the project implicit backend.
* `index.html` is a standalone html. It takes two parameters:
	* `task` the url to your task.xml file
	* `param` the url to your parameters file (by default iparam.xml)
