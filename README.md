## JS IAT

### Warning
This player is going out of use, it still gets bugfixes once in a while, but don't count on it to advance in any way...

If you are looking for a time sensitive player for creating an IAT (or many other things), you should check out the new [Project Implicit Player](https://github.com/ProjectImplicit/PIPlayer).

### About

This is an IAT player that is based on the [project implicit](implicit.harvard.edu) flash IAT player.

It supports touch devices.

There are two base files you can use:

* `iattask.jsp` is built for the project implicit backend.
* `index.html` is a standalone html. It takes two parameters:
	* `task` the url to your task.xml file
	* `param` the url to your parameters file (by default iparam.xml)
